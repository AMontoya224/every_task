                EverTask is an independent project that was born from the idea of being able to create an application 
                where people can write down the tasks they have to do in the day and also be able to perform 
                long-term tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                To be able to use this application, all you have to do is register and look for the verification 
                code in your email, enter it and you will be able to have a user profile.
